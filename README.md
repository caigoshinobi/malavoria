# Malavoria TTRPG
## Open Tabletop Roleplaying Game

**Malavoria** is a project that began in 2017. The idea was to create a simple role-playing game different from usual, fast-paced and with unusual characters. Due to lack of time it was abandoned for a few years, although the game mechanics and setting was practically finished. 
 
In the past the goal was to commercialize **Malavoria**, but I decided over the years to finalize and release it under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (waiting for the ORC). Images are generated using AI and released under Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 License too.

The project is *still under development*.
