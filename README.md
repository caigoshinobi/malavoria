# Malavoria OTTRPG
## Open Tabletop Roleplaying Game

Malavoria is a project that began in 2017. The idea was to create a simple role-playing game different from usual, fast-paced and with unusual characters. Due to lack of time it was abandoned for a few years, although the game mechanics and setting was practically finished. 
 
In this post there are some pictures of the first beta (20 copies) in Italian language. 
 
Although in the past the goal was to commercialize Malavoria, I decided over the years to finalize and release it under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (waiting for the ORC). Images are generated using AI and released under Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 License too.

The project is still under development.
